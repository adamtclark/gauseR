\description{
A dataset containing the abundances of Paramecium caudatum
and Didinium nasutum grown in mixture. Note, is for the same experiment
as gause_1934_book_f32, except that data were digitized separately,
and therefore have small variations. These might be useful for
estimating observation error in the data digitization process.
