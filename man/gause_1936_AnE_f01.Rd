\description{
A dataset containing the abundance of Cheyletus eruditus and Aleuiroglyphus agilis,
as apredator-prey system under different food conditions for the prey (wheat and millet).
Gause's goal was to determine the influence of ecological factors on predator-prey dynamics.
The number of individuals is reported as Individuals per 0.2 g prey food.
