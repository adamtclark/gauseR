\description{
A dataset containing the abundances of two Paramecium species
grown in monoculture and mixture. Note, is for the same experiment
as gause_book_1934_f22, except that data were digitized separately,
and therefore have small variations. These might be useful for
estimating observation error in the data digitization process.
"Volume" refers to a standardized index, meant to make the abundances
of species comparable based on their relative sizes.
